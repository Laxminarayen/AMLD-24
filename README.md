# Multimodal Machine Learning for Human Behaviour Understanding ðŸ¤–
This repo contains all the resources required for the AMLD 2024 workshop - Multimodal Machine Learning for Human Behaviour Understanding.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce Multimodal Machine Learning for human-centric AI applications. 
We will provide brief overview of processing different modalities like video, audio and text. There will be practical, hands-on code to extract features from these modalities in the below colab notebook.

Follow along with the workshop using the colab notebook
